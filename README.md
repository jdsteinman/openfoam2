Team Members: John Steinman, Wilson Watson, Nischal Shrestha, Antonio Esquivel 
 - Code is organized by section: i.e. part-x-section_name
 - Pertinant simulation files (log.blockMesh, log.checkMesh) are in data-config-files
 - Zipped outputs (except for fine-unsteady and strouhal tests) are in data-zips
